Matrix Brandy configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix Brandy now supports the use of a configuration file, which
supports most of the command-line options listed in 'brandy -help'
and additionally some tunables ordinarily set via the SYS command
at run-time.

The location of this configuration is:
RISC OS:    <Brandy$Dir>.brandyrc
Windows:    %APPDATA%\brandyrc
UNIX/Linux: $HOME/.brandyrc

These are:
bitshift64              This controls whether Brandy calculates bit shifts
                        in 64-bit space. 32-bit space is used when disabled
                        as per ARM BBC BASIC V/VI.

fullscreen              (SDL build only) Start Brandy in fullscreen mode.

hex64                   Equivalent to SYS "Brandy_Hex64",1.
                        This controls whether Brandy renders and interprets
                        Base 16 (Hexadecimal) values as 64-bit.

ignore                  (If strict mode enabled by default) Ignore certain
                        'unsupported feature' errors.
                        This option allows some unsupported features that do
                        not affect the basic running of the program to be
                        ignored.

intusesfloat            Equivalent to SYS"Brandy_INTusesFloat",1.
                        This enables a BB4W/BBCSDL extension that allows INT()
                        to handle numbers > 2^31-1 by using a float if the
                        number is out of range for a 32-bit signed integer.

legacyintmaths          Equivalent to SYS "Brandy_LegacyIntMaths",1.
                        This allows integer mathematics to be handled in the
                        way BBC BASIC 1 to 4 on the Acorn 8-bit machines, and
                        RISC OS ARM BBC BASIC V, including the rather
                        questionable wrap-around on integers. RISC OS ARM BBC
                        BASIC VI, BB4W and BBCSDL do not have this wrap-around
                        issue and will promote to float when needed.

lib <filename>          Load Basic library <filename> when the interpreter
                        starts. This option can be repeated as many times as
                        required to load a number of libraries. This is
                        equivalent to typing 'INSTALL <filename>' at the
                        interpreter's command line. The libraries are loaded
                        in the order given on the command line. Note that the
                        search order is the reverse of this.

listo <value>           Allow LISTO options value to be set automatically.

lowercase               Allow use of lower-case keywords. Unless LISTO option
                        bit 4 (16) is set, LIST will show keywords in
                        uppercase. SAVE will always save keywords in uppercase.

nocheck                 Don't try to check for new versions of Brandy on
                        interactive mode startup.  This is perhaps useful if
                        you have a slow internet connection that causes Brandy
                        to hang for a few seconds on startup as it tries to
                        check for a new version.

nofull                  (SDL build only) Never use fullscreen mode.

nostar                  Do not check commands issued via OSCLI to see if they
                        are dealt with by Brandy. Pass all commands to the
                        underlying operating system.

path <directory list>   This specifies a list of directories that the
                        interpreter will search when looking for libraries and
                        programs. The directory names are separated by commas.
                        The pseudo-variable 'FILEPATH$' is set to this value.
                        See the section below on FILEPATH$ for more details.

pseudovarsunsigned      Equivalent to SYS "Brandy_PseudovarsUnsigned",1.
                        Only effective on 32-bit hardware. Toggles whether
                        memory pseudo-variables (e.g. PAGE, HIMEM etc) return
                        large positive numbers above &7FFFFFFF.

size <size>             Set the size of the Basic workspace to <size> bytes
                        when starting the interpreter.  The minimum size
                        allowed is 16384 bytes and anything below this value
                        will be set to it. The maximum size is 4294966272
                        bytes (1K short of 4GB), The size may have a
                        suffix of 'k', 'm' or 'g' to denote that the size is
                        in kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively, for
                        example, '-size 100k' will set the workspace size to
                        100 kilobytes (102400 bytes) and '-size 8m' will set
                        it to eight megabytes (8388608 bytes).

startupmode <mode>      (SDL build only) Sets the start-up screen mode.
                        Any built-in mode can be selected by its mode number.
                        (See ScreenModes.txt)

strict                  (If ignore mode enabled by default) The interpreter
                        will report an error whenever it comes across a
                        BASIC V/VI feature that it does not support, and
                        some obvious BASIC program bugs that are ignored by
                        the Acorn interpreter.

swsurface               (SDL build only) Use a software SDL surface.

tek                     (Text-mode 'tbrandy' build only) Enable Tektronics
                        graphics.

zoom <amount>           (SDL build only) Zoom the display window by integer
                        <amount>, in the range 1-4.

Each option is to be listed on its own line.

Unrecognised options are silently ignored.  A - prefix of any option is
also ignored and also skipped over, so either
-nofull
  or
nofull
are equally valid.  Similarly, a parameter is separated from its option by
either a single space or a single '=' character.
